# Full node client of smartBCH

This repository contains the code of the full node client of smartBCH, an EVM&amp;Web3 compatible sidechain for Bitcoin Cash.

You can get more information at [smartbch.org](https://smartbch.org).

We are actively developing smartBCH and a testnet will launch soon. Before that, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/smartbch/smartbch/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and start [a private single node testnet](https://docs.smartbch.org/smartbch/deverlopers-guide/runsinglenode) to test your DApp.
